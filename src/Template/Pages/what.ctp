        <div class="qna-heading">HUNTS? MARKS?</div>
        <div class="qna-answer">A Hunt is a collection of tasks (Marks) that all have a recurring theme.
            There may be special rules or objectives for the hunt, so pay attention! <br />
            Marks are what you're looking for in-game. They can be abstract and conceptual, or VERY literal.
            Interpretation is key! You only get one chance to upload a mark, so make it count.

        <div class="qna-heading">WHATâ€™S THAT ABOUT VOTING?</div>
        <div class="qna-answer">Hunts are a time-based event, usually only a week long. After that period,
            all of the submissions will be open to be voted on! Pick your favorite (or your own, we don't care),
        and when the week is done, the results will be posted! The winner of each Mark will be awarded XP.</div>

        <div class="qna-answer">Your level is the best way to show off your skills and accomplishments! Earn XP by submitting
            screenshots, completing sets, and winning each mark. You'll earn rewards every new level, such as a new portrait
        around your avatar. Higher level players have higher-weighted votes, and may have other perks in the future.</div>
